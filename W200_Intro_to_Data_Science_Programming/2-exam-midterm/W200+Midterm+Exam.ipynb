Coding in a language such as C++ requires the programmer to be mindful of the different types of memory, processors, and other computer components. Using an interpreted language like python absolves the programmer of this responsibility an will likely come to benefit data scientists who work in large organizations that demand applications to be used over a wide variety of platforms.
