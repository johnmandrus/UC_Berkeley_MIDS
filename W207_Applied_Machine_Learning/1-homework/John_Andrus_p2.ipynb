    "In this project, you'll work with text data from newsgroup posts on a variety of topics. You'll train classifiers to distinguish posts by topics inferred from the text. Whereas with digit classification, where each input is relatively dense (represented as a 28x28 matrix of pixels, many of which are non-zero), here each document is relatively sparse (represented as a bag-of-words). Only a few words of the total vocabulary are active in any given document. The assumption is that a label depends only on the count of words, not their order.\n",

    "TfidfVectorizer is simply a CountVectorizer with the TfidfTransformer applied to it. This transformer converts the raw frequencies to Term Frequency times Inverse Document Frequency values that reduce the importance of terms that occur very frequently in the training data in order to strengthen the impact of less frequent, more informative terms. In this example of document classification, the tf-idf Vectorizer performs slightly better than the count vectorizer.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The model seems to misclassify religious posts that contain technical terminology, specifically the term ftp. I assume that this term occurs as a strong predictor in either the computer graphics or science and space categories, resulting in the misclassification. The R-Ratio identifies test examples who show a large discrepancy between the maximum predicted probability and the predicted probability of the correct label, in a way showing examples where the model is \"most wrong\". One possible way to improve the model's performance could be remove features that have high significance in two or more categories. "
